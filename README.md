📝 Task 1 – Task Manager
📘 Project Overview

1. This project is part of my @Algonive web development training tasks.
2. The goal of Task 1 is to create a web-based task management system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks with deadlines.
3. The application helps users manage their daily goals efficiently with features like deadline reminders and persistent data storage using Local Storage.

🎯 Objective

* To design and implement a simple yet powerful Task Manager that enables users to:
* Add new tasks with title, description, and due date.
* Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
* Filter and manage tasks based on completion status.
* Automatically save data persistently using local storage.
* Provide reminder notifications for upcoming deadlines.

⚙️ Key Features
✅ Task Creation

1. Users can easily add new tasks by entering:
2. Title – short name of the task.
3. Description – details about the task.
4. Due Date – task deadline.

✏️ Edit & Delete Tasks

Each task can be edited or deleted at any time, giving full flexibility to manage schedules.

🔄 Mark as Complete / Incomplete

Users can toggle task status to keep track of progress efficiently.

💾 Persistent Storage

Tasks are stored in Local Storage, ensuring they remain available even after refreshing or closing the browser.

⏰ Reminder Notifications

A built-in reminder system checks deadlines and alerts the user when a task is nearing its due date.

🎨 Responsive UI

A clean and minimal interface is designed with HTML & CSS, ensuring usability across desktop and mobile devices.

🧠 System Workflow

* Add Task
The user enters task details and clicks “Add Task.”
JavaScript dynamically updates the task list and saves the entry to local storage.

* View & Manage Tasks
All tasks are displayed with their status and due date.
Users can filter between All, Completed, and Pending tasks.

* Mark Completion
Clicking on a checkbox updates the task’s status visually and in local storage.

* Reminders
If the current date is close to a task’s due date, the app notifies the user visually (highlight color or alert).
